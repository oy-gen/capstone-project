# B2B Shopify App for Small Businesses

This is a capstone project done during my web development bootcamp @ [neuefische](neuefische). The app is optimized for mobile.
You can fetch your shopify products and assign new wholesale prices and order conditions. Your settigns are saved in a database. The shopping experience is designed for fast, high quantity purchases, showing your assigned prices and conditions to your clients.
