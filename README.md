# B2B Shopify App for Small Businesses

This is my capstone project created during my web development bootcamp at [neuefische](neuefische).
You can fetch your shopify products and assign new wholesale prices and order conditions. Your settigns are saved in a database. The store front shopping experience is designed for fast, high quantity purchases, showing your assigned prices and conditions to your clients.

Tech stack:

- react
- next.js
- mongoDB
- styled components
- MUI
- zustand
- react hook form
- YUP resolver
- shopify buy SDK
- node.js

The app is optimized for iPhone SE - guideline specified by [neuefische](neuefische).
